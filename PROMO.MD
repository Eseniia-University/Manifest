# Manifest for CoreLang: An Open Low-Level Programming Language

## Introduction
**CoreLang** is an open-source low-level programming language designed specifically for system programming tasks such as developing operating systems, bootloaders, drivers, and other critical components. It aims to provide developers with complete control over hardware while enhancing security, readability, and portability across various architectures.

## Objectives and Design of CoreLang

1. **Full Hardware Control:** CoreLang offers direct access to hardware, enabling efficient manipulation of registers, memory, and I/O devices.
2. **Enhanced Security:** Built-in safety mechanisms, like bounds checking and exception handling, reduce errors typical in low-level programming.
3. **Simplified Syntax:** Designed for readability and usability, making low-level programming more accessible.
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Supports major architectures (e.g., x86, ARM, RISC-V) to make the language adaptable and versatile.

## Key Language Features

### 1. Strict Static Typing
CoreLang enforces strict type safety to minimize errors and optimize performance.

### 2. Direct Memory and Register Access
The language allows direct manipulation of memory and registers, which is essential for low-level programming tasks.

### 3. Minimalistic Standard Library
A lean library containing essential functions (e.g., memory and I/O operations) ensures efficiency and supports system-level programming without unnecessary overhead.

### 4. Inline Assembly Integration
CoreLang enables inline assembly within the code, allowing precise hardware control and optimization in critical sections.

### 5. Modular Architecture and Microkernel Support
CoreLang’s modular system supports a microkernel approach, making it ideal for creating modular OS kernels, drivers, and bootloaders.

## CoreLang Syntax and Structure

### Basic Data Types
CoreLang supports a limited set of basic data types optimized for low-level control:
- **u8, u16, u32:** Unsigned integers.
- **i8, i16, i32:** Signed integers.
- **reg:** Special type for processor registers.
- **ptr:** Pointer type for addressing memory.

### Memory Management
CoreLang provides pointer arithmetic and direct memory access, allowing precise control over memory.

```rust
// Example: Writing to a memory address
let *buffer: u8[256] = 0x8000;
*buffer = 0xAA;
Inline Assembly
CoreLang includes syntax for inline assembly, enabling developers to embed low-level instructions directly.

fn main() -> void {
    let reg_ptr: *u32 = 0xFF00ABCD;
    asm {
        mov eax, [reg_ptr];
        inc eax;
        mov [reg_ptr], eax;
    }
}
Flow Control and Loops
The language includes simple loops and conditional constructs for flexible control flow.

rust
Копировать код
let counter: u8 = 0;
while (counter < 10) {
    counter += 1;
    if (counter == 5) {
        break;
    }
}
Compiler Core and Infrastructure
Compiler (clc)
The CoreLang compiler, clc, translates code into machine instructions, providing optimizations for performance-critical sections. The compiler supports multiple architectures (e.g., x86, ARM).

Development Environment and Debugger
CoreIDE serves as an integrated development environment for CoreLang, offering tools for debugging, performance analysis, and tracking code execution.

Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Research and Design
Define language objectives and functions.
Design syntax and core language structure.
Phase 2: Compiler Development and Testing
Develop the clc compiler.
Implement essential commands and data structures.
Phase 3: IDE and Tooling
Develop CoreIDE with debugging and profiling tools.
Provide a minimal standard library for basic operations.
Phase 4: Community and Open Development
Release a beta version to gather feedback.
Develop comprehensive documentation and establish a community platform.
Phase 5: Stable Release and Expansion
Ensure stability and optimize for multiple architectures.
Build a developer community and continue iterative improvements.
Conclusion
CoreLang aims to bring powerful and flexible hardware-level control into an open, accessible programming language. By combining modern syntax, extensive hardware control, and safety features, CoreLang is designed to support both experienced system programmers and those new to low-level programming.

This manifesto sets out to create a language that prioritizes performance, security, and community involvement, becoming a foundational tool for developing high-performance system components.
